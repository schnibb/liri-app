# liri

This is an application that takes in user input to search for song information, bands in town information, or movie information.  Once that information is obtained the application will provide the desired information to the user.

To use the application you will type in node liri.js and then the search parameters, examples below.

node liri.js concert-this <band/artist name> = this will display the upcoming concerts for the searched for band/artist and provide the venue, the location of the venue and the start time.

node liri.js spotify-this-song <song title> = this will call spotify and retrieve information in reference to the song inquired.  If you do not enter a song to search for, information for "The Sign" by Ace of Base will be displayed by default.
  
node liri.js movie-this <movie title> = will display information about the desired film.
  
node do-what-i-say will call from the random.txt file to search spotify for the song "I want it that way" and display the information to the screen.

if you do not enter in a correct search requirement then you will receive a message atating "You did not enter an appropriate request."

here is a link to a video of how the application should function.
